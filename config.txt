# This is an example of a config file that can contain all the parameters you want to load
# with the ArgParser object. Quick notes below:
#
# 1) Any line that starts with a '#' or space will be ignored.
# 2) Parameter names will be changed to all lowercase unless set to False with the ArgParser 
#    initialization. The values associated with the parameters will keep their original forms
